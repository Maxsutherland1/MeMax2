    <h4>I am a motivated self learner that love learning new how to improve</h4>

    <p> I used to be an outcast and thought that I could prove myself by killing a dragon but not only any dragon. I was going to kill a Night Fury. When it came time to kill my fist dragon I couldn't mostly because i saw my self in this dragon. long story short we became freinds and there was a huge battle with some other dragons and i taught my village that dragons aren't all bad. Now we ride them and co-exist. You to can train and live with dragons. </p>
